TextMate is my editor of choice but it's not very sexy at first.

Here is how you can make it funkier.

The [ProjectPlus](http://ciaranwal.sh/projectplus "Project Plus") plugin gives you SCM status badges (Git, SVN, Mercurial, Bazaar & Svk), it swaps the project drawer to a panel for a less tigerish look, it can display Finder colour labels.
It can also save project-tree state and sort files and folders.

The [Minimap](http://julianeberius.github.com/Textmate-Minimap/ "Minimap") plugin brings a drawer with a zoomed-out view of your code a la [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "Sublime Text").

Other plugins worth trying are [XMLMate](http://ditchnet.org/xmlmate/) and [TMCodeBrowser](http://www.cocoabits.com/TmCodeBrowser/) for easy XML and code browsing.

For the aesthetics pimping, I use is the [Monokai](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/ "Monokai") color scheme, [Github Web Preview](http://github.com/kneath/github_textmate_preview "Github Web Preview") and the green moleskine [icon and splash screen](http://jason-evers.com/code/code-like-i-do).

Now you have the coolest editor that even the VI/Emacs cool kids will envy!
